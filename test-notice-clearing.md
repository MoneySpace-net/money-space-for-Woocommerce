# Notice Clearing & Dropdown Interaction Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Notice Clearing Issue
The `wc-block-components-notices` not auto-clearing when switching from installment to QR code payment methods.

### 2. Dropdown Interaction Issue ⭐ NEW FIX
Dropdown menus in installment payment method not clickable/interactive.

## What Was Changed

### 1. Enhanced CreditCardInstallmentForm.js
- **Notice Clearing**: Improved notice clearing mechanism with multiple methods
- **Event Handling**: Fixed conflicting event listeners that were blocking dropdown interactions
- **Debugging**: Added console logging for better debugging
- **Dropdown Fix**: Removed event listeners from payment container that were interfering with dropdowns

### 2. Updated QR Code Payment Method (qrcode.js)
- Added notice clearing functionality when QR payment is selected
- Clears notices from other payment methods (installment, credit card)

### 3. Enhanced CreditCardForm.js
- Similar improvements to installment form
- Fixed event listener conflicts that could affect form interactions

### 4. Updated Styles (styles.scss)
- Added `mns-hidden` class for more effective notice hiding
- **NEW**: Added specific styles for dropdown functionality:
  - `pointer-events: auto !important` on select elements
  - `z-index` management for proper layering
  - Dropdown arrow visibility fixes
  - Label interaction prevention
  - Container interaction management

## How to Test

### 1. **Test Notice Clearing (Original Issue):**
   - Go to checkout page
   - Select MoneySpace Installment payment
   - Try to place order without selecting bank (should show validation notice)
   - Switch to QR Code payment method
   - **Expected:** Validation notices should automatically disappear

### 2. **Test Dropdown Interaction (NEW FIX):**
   - Go to checkout page
   - Select MoneySpace Installment payment
   - Select a bank (KTC, BAY, or FCY)
   - **Expected:** Dropdown should open and show month options
   - Click on the months dropdown
   - **Expected:** Should be able to select different month options
   - Try selecting different months
   - **Expected:** Selection should update properly

### 3. **Test Cross-Method Switching:**
   - Test switching between all three payment methods
   - Verify dropdowns work after switching back to installment
   - **Expected:** All interactions should work smoothly

## Technical Details

### Dropdown Fix Details:
1. **Removed Conflicting Event Listeners**: 
   - Removed `click` event listeners on payment container
   - Made event detection more specific to actual payment method changes only
   - Added guards to prevent processing non-payment-method events

2. **CSS Enhancements**:
   ```scss
   .wc-block-components-credit-card-installment-form {
     select {
       pointer-events: auto !important;
       z-index: 10 !important;
       cursor: pointer !important;
       -webkit-appearance: menulist !important;
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Event Handler Improvements**:
   - Added name validation: `if (!event.target?.name?.includes('radio-control-wc-payment-method-options'))`
   - Removed container-level event listeners that were causing conflicts
   - Added debug logging for better troubleshooting

### Root Cause of Dropdown Issue:
The enhanced notice clearing system was adding event listeners to the payment methods container (`.wc-block-components-radio-control`) which was intercepting click events that should have gone to the dropdown selects, preventing them from opening.
